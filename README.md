# SML-PDFfiller
It creates PDFs from excel files

It gets a PDF and an Excel file and uses each row of the Excel file to create a new PDF
The column headers must correspond to the PDF field names
Each row creates a new PDF file with the name Output(Column number) 
It is used when you have to fill out a lot of the same PDF from an Excel file
Right now you have to change the code to match the PDF fields.  I want to make it where it automatically gets the field names from the column headers
